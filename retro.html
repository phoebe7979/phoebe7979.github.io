    <h2>Enhancing meeting efficiency for 170 development teams at Ford by closely examining the productivity tool</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      For a course project, I worked in a team of four UX-focused students to provide usability consulting service for RetroQuest -- an open source web application developed by FordLabs for running weekly retrospecitves. <br><br>
      The web application’s current target users are internal teams at Ford. On a weekly basis, <b>90-170 teams</b> at Ford run their retrospecitve meetings on RetroQuest. With only one designer in charge of the UX of the application, the development team is seeking consulting from our team to help them thoroughly evaluate the application's usability to <b>boost retro efficiency for internal employees.</b>
      <br><br></p>
    <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">THE METHODOGY</h3>
    <h2>Examining the web application via six different approaches</h2><br>
    <p>We assessed RetroQuest comprehensively using six different methods according to different research questions, gathering both quantitative abd qualitative data to help us generate key recommendations for our clients.</p> <br><br>

    <br><br>
    <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">INTERACTION MAP</h3>
    <h2>What are all possible interactions on RetroQuest?</h2><br>
    <p>To better understand the application, we started by visualizting all possible interactions on the interface to learn how users can engage with the system in different ways.</p>
    <br><br>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href = "imgs/retro/interactionmap.pdf" target = "_blank"><img alt = "interaction map" src = "imgs/retro/interactionmap.PNG"></a>
    </div><br><br>
    <p>While the application worked smoothly for the most part, we did found two apparent issues.</p>

<br><br>
    <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
    <h2>How do the competitors approach similar features?</h2><br><br>
    <p>Next, we conducted a thorough analysis with 6 direct (FunRetro, GoReflect, ScatterSpoke) and partial (Trello, Basecamp, Airtable) competitors to see what they did well that can be receommended to RetroQuest.</br>
      <div class ="flex-row">

    <p>We identified 6 great features that the competitors have and recommended them to RetroQuest:</p>

    <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">USER INTERVIEWS</h3>
    <h2>Who are the users? What are their motivations and frustrations?/h2><br><br>
    <p>In order to understand how users feel using RetroQuest, we conducted 5 semi-structured interviews with different roles at Ford. The interview protocol can be found <a href = "imgs/hellenic/protocol.pdf" target="_blank ">here </a>. <br><br></p>
    <p>We were excited to find that some user frustrations aligned with our previous findings from interaction map and comparative analysis. The interviewees expressed their frustrations as follows, with starred ones being similar findings we have had from past research:</p><br><br>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/retro/quotes.png" data-lightbox="user quotes" data-title="User quotes"><img class="img-height-450px" src="imgs/retro/quotes.png" alt="user quotes"/></a>
    </div>
    <p>We also developed personas to illustrate the major user using the application, their motivations and frustrations.</b></p>
    <br><br>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href = "imgs/retro/persona.png" target = "_blank"><img alt = "persona" src = "imgs/retro/persona.png"></a>
    </div><br>
    <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">SURVEY</h3>
    <h2>What are users’ attitude about RetroQuest and proposed features?</h2><br><br>
    <p>With findings from previous research, we have gathered several theories and assumptions that could help improve the application. To see whether these considerations are really needed by the majority of the users and their attitudes about them, we distributed a survey to employees at Ford. <br><br>
    Within 5 days, we received 81 responses. Using Tableau and excel, we visualized the data to easily interpret the results.
    </b></p><br>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <img alt = "chart" src = "imgs/retro/charts.png"></a>
    </div><br><br><br>
    <p>From the results, we have a better learning about the users:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Respondents that currently use RetroQuest are active on 1.41 team boards on average</li>
      <li>Most respondents do not like to show their names on their cards, claiming that they do not have difficulty remembering creating a card.</li>
      <li>Users prefer RetroQuest to be simple, without having too many features.</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    <p>We have also identified 4 most requested features to be added on RetroQuest:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be able to set a timer for each card to be aware of time</li>
      <li>Sort all columns by clicking one button</li>
      <li>Drag and drop cards across different columns and positions</li>
      <li>Track team performance and sentiment with visual analytics</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">HEURISTICS EVALUATION</h3>
    <h2>How many, if any, usability problems does RetroQuest have?</h2><br><br>
    <p>We constructed a set of 13 heuristics from Nielsen(1995), Farooq et al. (2008), and Hermann (2009) to examine RetroQuest from general user interface design point of view, and it's effectiveness in computer-supported cooperative work. The heuristics are:</p>
    <br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Visibility of system status</li>
        <li>Match between system and the real world</li>
        <li>Communication around shared work should be able to happen in real time as the work is done</li>
        <li>User control and freedom</li>
        <li>Consistency and standards</li>
        <li>Error prevention</li>
        <li>Recognition rather than recall</li>
        <li>Support flexibility in the granularity of planning</li>
        <li>Aesthetic and minimalist design</li>
        <li>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</li>
        <li>Help and documentation</li>
        <li>Support the big picture and visualization of rich material</li>
        <li>Support merges and document them</li>
      </ul>
    <br><br>
    <p>In the end, we identified 18 violations, with 10 of them rated more than 3 out of 4 scores in severity level.

    <br><br>
    <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">USABILITY TESTING</h3>
    <h2>What parts of RetroQuest mobile view and new archive design work well? What do not work so well?</h2><br><br>
    <p>At this point, we have only examined issues on the desktop browser view. To understand how RetroQuest performs on the mobile view, as well as users' experience on the new interface in the archive page, we conducted a series of usability test with 5 users.<br><br>
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Each session lasted 30-40 minutes. On their own mobile phones, the participants performs 7 common tasks following a standard retrospective procedure. On a desktop browser, the participants perform one task with two subtasks to check historic board details. The whole testing script and task details can be accessed <a href = "imgs/retro/scripts.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a><br><br>
