    <h3>Consulting team tasked with operation improvement for local NPO</h3><br>
    <p>Every week, the food bank receives up to five food recall notices from USDA and other public sectors. With tons of food donated every week from all kinds of sources, however, the organization finds it <b>challenging to sort the bulk of donated food and keep the recalled items from further distribution</b>. Currently, the organization selects recall notices manually and only posts fewer than 30 recall food notices in the warehouse a time, resulting in the risk of serving tainted food to distribution channels. A better procedure is therefore urgently needed in order to ensure no tainted food is distrubuted to downstream pantries.</p><br>
    <p>For the course <b>Contextual Inquiry and Consulting Foundations</b>, I worked in a <b>team of five classmates</b> to provide a solution for the food bank.</p>
    <br>

    <p>For the course <b>Contextual Inquiry and Consulting Foundations</b>, I worked in a <b>team of five classmates</b> to provide a number of possible solutions for the food bank.</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>Implement <b>regular drills</b> to address system weaknesses and improve response times.</li>
    <li>Enhanced donation management including <b>donor inventory list, flyer for storage racks, and adjusted flyer placement. </b></li>
    <li><b>Increased notification exposure.</b></li>
    <li>Addition of new <b>dedicated volunteer positions.</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">Contextual Inquiry</h2>
    <p>To understand the scope of the problem and its root causes, we conducted qualitative research both individually and collaboratively.</p><br>
    <br>
      <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">Background Research</h5><br><br>
      <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "icon or research" src = "imgs/food-bank/seo.png"></div>
      <p>In order to aquire comprehensive understanding of our client and their problem, each team member worked separately to research on one aspect of the problem. <b> I was in charge of analyzing other food banks in the state of Michigan.</b> <br>
      By gathering information from academic and organization website resources, I <b>compared and contrasted all seven food banks</b> in Michigan in terms of the following topics:<br>
      <ul>
      <li>Background</li>
      <li>Vision and focuses</li>
      <li>Resources</li>
      <li>Services, including regions, channels, and amount of food served</li>
      <li>Resources</li>
      <li>Food management practices</li>
      <li>Food recall management strategies</li>
      </ul><br>
      <p>Particularly standing out from the comparison is how the <b>client presents information in their documents differently</b>: while other food banks details out food handling process extensively and explicitly in training documents, the organization deploys a <b>simpler approach</b>, where training guidelines are presented in very simple charts.</p>
      <br><br>

      <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">Interviews</h5><br><br>
      <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "icon or research" src = "imgs/food-bank/reunion.png"></div>
      <p>We then later worked in pairs and conducted <b>six interviews with different roles</b> at our client's facility:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Warehouse manager</li>
      <li>Volunteer program manager</li>
      <li>Partner program coodinator</li>
      <li>Transportation manager</li>
      <li>Contact windows of two partner agencies</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>To gain as much valuable data from our interviewees as possible, each interview was held following <b>pre-designed interview protocols</b>, where an overarching question has been idientified for individual interviewee. Three questions sets were then developed based on the overarching issue, with about three to four questions for each question set. In addition, to learn the most of the client's situation, we <b>followed the contextual inquiry strategy,</b> where we saw ourselves as <b>apprentice</b> observing the interveiwees' ordinary tasks and asking questions whenever needed. The interviews turned out to take from 40 to 60 minutes.</p>
      <br><br>

      <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">Affinity Wall</h5><br><br>
      <div class ="flex-row">    <img src="imgs/food-bank/affinity-wall-512x384.JPG" alt="affinity wall"></div>
          <p>During the nterpretation session, the team played back the audio recording and noted down <b>one issue roughly every minute</b>. In the end, we collected approximately 270 notes for all 6 interviews.
          <br><br>
          We then started to build an affinity wall from the notes to learn the most crutial issues of the problems. <br><br>To aim for most efficiency, I proposed a slightly different workflow from the instructor's guideline, which was then supported by the other members:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Instead of laying out all notes on the wall and group directly, each of us take 20 random notes first.</li>
          <li>Individually, sort the notes at hand into clusters and name the clusters in a specific sentence. Leave extremely hard ones aside.</li>
          <li>One by one, each of us share the existing cluster names. If it happens that other people have almost identical group clusters, merge the groups.</li>
          <li>Each member take another 20 notes and repeat the steps.</li>
          </ul>
          <br><br>
          <p>After the first few rounds, everyone of us started to have <b>good sense of what clusters there were around our seats</b>. Whenever any member was unsure of a certain note, he/she then read out the notes, while other members responded if a suitable cluster was nearby. The whole process was very dynamic.</p><br>
                <div class ="flex-row"> <img src = "imgs/food-bank/wall.gif" alt = "building affinity wall"/></div>
          <br>
          <p>From there, we started to build the second layer, which were meta-clusters. With each of us knowing what clusters were around, we would able to easily group relevant clusters into a larger meta-cluster. Interestingly, while summarizing from the cluster notes to name the meta-cluster, we were able to gain several insights that were not obvious before. </p><br>

          <p>In the end, we built a wall of four layers, with <b>several key findings</b>:</p><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Overconfidence was observed, resulting in <b>lack of immediacy in recall dealings.</b></li>
            <li>Current alerts to downtream partners rely on <b>single point of communication</b>, which may limit the level of understanding.</li>
            <li>Significant <b>time gap</b> is observed between relevant recall flyers postings, intended to guide food sorting, and the moment when food donation sorting actually takes place.</li>
            <li>The current sorting process, reliant on <b>visual checks and lacking distribution of difficult tasks</b>. increases the chances of human error.</li>
            <li>Volunteer resources are plentiful, well-nurtured and can be further deployed to help optimize the recall management.</li>
          </ul><br><br>
      <br><br>

    <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">Solution Brainstorming</h5><br><br>
      <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "icon or research" src = "imgs/food-bank/brainstorming.JPG"></div>
      <p>After learning about the main problem from our findings, the team moved on to brainstorm solutions. After we have gathered <b>18 differnt ideas</b>, we used a rubric with weighted facotrs to pick out the top solutions.</p>
