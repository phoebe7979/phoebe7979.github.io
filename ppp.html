      <h6>THE CHALLENGE</h6>
      <h2>How might we help code enforcement officers leverage Dynamo Metrics' data power for their daily inspection work?</h2>
      <p>
      <br>
       As a data-visualization and consulting company, Dynamo Metrics' has been in the making of a tailor-made data visualization application for the code enforcement team at the City of Jackson. With little UX resources, the company was in need of professioal insights to deliver an optimal solution. Our team was tasked with understanding user needs and translating them into design solutions for the application.

      <h6>KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS</h6>
      <h2>Insights generated from multiple research methods</h2>
      <p>
        Over the course of heuristic evaluation, field research, observation and interviews, our findings can be categorized into four key areas.
       <br><br>

      <h6>THE SOLUTION: NEIGHBORHOOD DATA</h6>
      <h2>Streamlined experinece viewing urban data on a single web application</h2>
      <p>
        I was solely responsible for redesigning the neighborhood data feature of the application. By keeping only the most important elements while adding necessary functionality based on the results of research, I created a series of mockups and interactions for the redesigned UI.
       <br><br>
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h5>Neighborhood Summary</h5>
      <p>
        <b>Pain Point</b><br>
        Officers switched between different pages on their previous platform, and rely on other department's analytics to aggregate neightborhood data. They could not quickly prioritize patroling resource.
        <br>
        <b>Solution</b><br>
        Officers can check instant summary of an area on the map. A newly added 'changeability index' notifies officers of how easy an area's code violations can be effectively reduced. This can help the code enforcement team allocate thei resources efficiently.
      </p>

      <h5>New Layer Adding Process</h5>
      <p>
        <b>Pain Point</b><br>
        The old UI from our client requires the user to add data layer by selecting from a long list of checkboxes. Users have to manually uncheck and recheck an item in order to move a layer to the top.
        <br>
        <b>Solution</b><br>
        Data types are added with a separated layer building process. Data layers are now draggable for reorder, with feature to toggle visibility for quick data interpretation.
      </p>
