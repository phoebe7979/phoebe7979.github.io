    <h2>How can the client's existing technology meet code enforcement officers' needs?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      For <b>a semester-based extracurricular UX consulting initiative</b>, I worked in <b>a team of two data scientists and three UX designers</b> to enhance the <a href="http://dynamometrics.com" target="_blank">Dynamo Metrics</a>, a data visualization company. <br><br>
      The company's prospecitve project is a <b>tailor-made data visualization application for the code enforcement team at the City of Jackson</b>. With little UX background and resource, the company is in need of professioal insights to deliver optimal solution. Our deliverables were to <b>conduct user research</b> and <b>provide a mid-fi mockup</b><br><br></p>
      <div class ="flex-row white-bg">
        <img src = "imgs/ppp/org.png" alt="the structure of the project">
      </div><br><br>


    <br>
    <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">FINAL REDESIGN - NEIGHBORHOOD DATA</h3>
    <h2>Keeping only 1/10 of visual elements on the 'neighborhood data' interface</h2><br>
    <p>After a series of user research, I am <b>solely responsible for redesigning the neighborhood data feature</b> of the application. By keeping only the most important elements while adding necessary functionality based on the results of research, I created a series of mockups and interactions for the redesigned UI</b>.</p>
    <br><br>
    <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "mockups" src = "imgs/ppp/finaldesign.png"></div>


    <br>
    <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">THE PROCESS</h3>
    <h2>From zero to final pitch</h2><br>
      <div class ="flex-row white-bg"><img alt = "process" src = "imgs/ppp/process.jpg"></div>
    <br>
    <p>The team has communicated effectively with client upfront to learn their expectations. After the initial meeting, we have learned that <b>the client's biggest hope is to understand the user needs from a UX point of view</b>. We have thus agreed upon delivering a presentation on our findings by the end of the year, while providing mid-to-high-fidelity mockups based on our findings for the clients further consideration.</p>


    <br>
    <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">UX RESEARCH</h3>
    <h2>What exactly is code enforcement? Understanding users from a completely unfamiliar field.</h2><br>
    <p>The end users for this projects are very simple -- the Code Enforcement Department of the City of Jackson Government. My teammates and I took several steps to learn about who the users really are, as well as their needs.</p>

    <br>

    <br>

    <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Background Reserach</h5><br>
      <br>
      <p>Without much prior knowledge of both our clients and the users, the whole team conducted a throrough background research by <b>researching the client's past projects, inspecting current software interface,</b> as well as reading governmental webpages and documents to understand the Code Enforcement Department's <b>various code ordinances they are responsible for</b>.</p><br>
      <div class = "flex-row">
          <img alt = "A blurred screenshot of the competitive analysis" src = "imgs/ppp/bgresearch.png">
      </div>
      <p>Aside from understanding related ordinances, we especially paid attention to the <b>common complaints and violations that code enforcement officers often have to deal with</b>.</p><br>
      <br><br>
    <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Interaction Analysis</h5><br>
      <br>
      <p>
        By using a <b>heuristic approach</b>, I analyzed the current map UI for layering and filtering feature and found several problems.
      </p><br><br>
      <div class = "flex-row">
        <img class = "img-height-450px" alt = "screenshot of current UI" src = "imgs/ppp/neighborhoodintel.JPG">
      </div>
      <div class = "flex-row">
        <div class = "third-block"><br>
          <h4>Missing Legend</h4><br>
          <h5>Standard maps usually have a lengend panel to indicate the relationship between map pattern and data. The current UI does not have such featur, making it difficult to interpret the visualized data.</h5>
        </div>
        <div class = "third-block"><br>
          <h4>Long Menu</h4><br>
          <h5>Current UI utilizes a long menu to display layering options, taking up much real estate. The menu has a total of 8 accordians with 3 radius buttons and 42 checkboxes.</h5>
        </div>
        <div class = "third-block"><br>
          <h4>Lack of status and user control</h4><br>
          <h5>Both the playback feature and the layering menu lack of clear status about what data types are being displayed, as well as clear affordance for user configuration. </h5>
        </div>
      </div>

      <br><br>
    <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Competitive Analysis</h5><br>
      <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "A blurred screenshot of the competitive analysis" src = "imgs/ppp/competitive.JPG"></div>
      <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "Companies of competitive analysis" src = "imgs/ppp/competitive2.jpg"></div>
      <p>We then proceeded with competitive analysis with five code enforcement management applications and one data visuazliation web solution, for which we examined the following aspects based on public information on their websites: <br></p><br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Platform & supported devices</b></li>
        <li><b>Data types</b></li>
        <li><b>Key workflow</b></li>
        <li><b>UI elements</b></li>
      </ul><br>
      <p>The results showed that <b>most applications are browser-friendly, but whether the content is mobile friendly is unknown </b>(available information all showed desktop view). Considering <b>officers may require access to certain data during their missions on-site</b>, having a mobile/tablet-friendly solution may be useful.</b> <br> <br>In addition, some competitors provide summative data or index. Our client's current application <b>would improve by adding predictive and summative data </b>for users to quickly learn the status of an area. <br><br>As for the key workflow, <b>most competitors offer productivity and administrative features</b> aside from data visualization tasks so the users can complete most tasks including issuing permits, file complaints, reporting blights, and update property status, all on a single software; on the other hand, our client's solution specifically focuses on the city data visualization.<br><br>In terms of visual presentation and interaction experience, our clients' curernt design incorporates multiple accordions and checkboxes, which result in <b>much visual burden and interaction cost</b>, while wasting quite some space. On the other hand, two competitors utilized floating blocks or hidden features to solve the space issue, providing more real estate for the focus of the application -- the visual presentation of the data.
      <br><br>
      In the end of the analysis, we were left with two questions that we aimed to explore during the user interviews: <b>current administrative software experience and mobile applciation needs.</b></p>
      <br><br>
    <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">User Interviews</h5><br>
      <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "interview icon" src = "imgs/ppp/interview.png"></div>
      <p><b>Four interviews</b> were conducted at the City of Jackson with potential users in the government. These included the <b>head of the code enforcement team, two code enforcement officers, as well as the code enforcement administrator</b>. Prior to the interview, the whole team worked together on a semi-structured interview protocol with an aim to elicit specific details regarding the interviewee's <b>background, job responsibilities, daily workflow, challenges, and expectations</b>. </p><br><br>
      <p>After the interview, the UX team interpreted the data and organized the notes into a structured affinity wall, including:</p><br>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Daily tasks & responsibilities</b></li>
      <li><b>Issues regarding workflow & current tools</b></li>
      <li><b>Data types in need</b></li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <div class = "flex-row white-bg">
        <a href="imgs/ppp/affinitywall.jpg" target="_blank" ><img class="img-height-450px" src="imgs/ppp/affinitywall.jpg" alt="affinity wall"/></a>
      </div>
      <br><br>
    <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Personas</h5><br>
      <div class ="flex-row">
        <a href="imgs/ppp/persona1.png" target="_blank" ><img alt = "Persona" class="graphics-img" src = "imgs/ppp/persona1.png"></a>
        <a href="imgs/ppp/persona2.png" target="_blank" ><img alt = "Persona" class="graphics-img" src = "imgs/ppp/persona2.png"></a>
        <a href="imgs/ppp/persona3.png" target="_blank" ><img alt = "Secondary persona" class="graphics-img" src = "imgs/ppp/persona3.png"></a>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>After the interviews, each UX designer developed a persona, each representing a type of the end users: <b>head of the code enforcement department, code enforcement officer, and administrator</b>.</p>
      <br><br>
    <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Design Goals</h5><br><br>
      <p>With affinity wall and persona, we agreed upon a set of aligned goals of the envisioned final design. </p>
      <br>
      <div class = "flex-row">
        <div class = "third-block"><br>
          <img src = "imgs/ppp/door.png" alt = "door icon"/><br>
          <h4>Data Accessibility</h4><br>
          <h5>Not only should shareable data from other sectors be accessibile, but the platform should be used on tablets as well.</h5>
        </div>
        <div class = "third-block"><br>
          <img src = "imgs/ppp/graph.png" alt = "graph icon"/><br>
          <h4>Summative Metrics</h4><br>
          <h5>A few numbers should assist in identifying the most prioritized tasks for allocating manpower.</h5>
        </div>
        <div class = "third-block"><br>
          <img src = "imgs/ppp/connections.png" alt = "connection icon"/><br>
          <h4>Shareability</h4><br>
          <h5>Data sharing feature could help connect team members together to enhance the city more efficiently. </h5>
        </div>
      </div>


      <br><br>
    <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Workflow Analysis</h5><br>
      <div class ="flex-row"><a href = "imgs/ppp/workflow.png" target= "_blank"><img alt = "Workflow analysis" src = "imgs/ppp/workflow.png"></a></div>
      <p>Prior to the design phase, the UX team developed a flowchart that details the daily routine, behaviors, and required data for code enforcement officers. After identifying necessary data to be made accessible on the application, we were separated the dataa into property-related data and neighborhood-related data, and used a quick card sorting session to group different types of information into different tabs on the propspective interface.</p>
      <br><br>

    <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">ITERATIONS</h3>
    <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Wireframe and Low-Fidelity Mockup</h5><br>
    <div class ="flex-row"><img class = "img-height-450px" alt = "design discussion" src = "imgs/ppp/board.jpg"></div>
    <p>To quickly develop a consistent design across the team, we held a meeting to discuss the general look of the redesign, as well as grouping relevant features. Each designer then started out to provide first mockup sets for the responsible feature.<br><br>
    I opted to work on the neighborhood data, which includes three main features: <b>adding layers and filtering, locating a district, and presenting neighbord data on hover.</b></p>
    <div class ="flex-row"><a href="imgs/ppp/lfprototype.JPG"><img class = "img-height-450px" alt = "low-fidelity prototype" src = "imgs/ppp/lfprototype.JPG"></div></a>
    <br><br>
    <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Higher Fidelity Mockup</h5><br>
    <p>After finishing the first iteration, us UX designers held a second meeting to <b>critique exisiting design and determine the design system for higher fidelity iterations</b>. We opted to use two shades of orange as the primary color to align with the client's brand image. The color schema is presented below.<br><br>
        <div class ="flex-row"><a href="imgs/ppp/colorpalette.png"><img class = "img-height-450px" alt = "low-fidelity prototype" src = "imgs/ppp/colorpalette.png"></div></a>
    <br><br>
    <p>In the second iteration, I have refined the design based on feedback given by my teammates. These include:<br><br></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Playback feature:</b> Keeping only the date info, while adding a setting button for granular configurations.</li>
      <li><b>Pinned location feature:</b> Aside from locating an area or address, allow users to pin locations to better plan for their daily inspection tasks.</li>
      <li><b>Moving map layering and locating features to the right:</b> Separate page tabs with in-page setting panels, such that the map remains in the central focus of the screen.</li>
    </ul><br><br>

    <h2>The presentation day and an opportunity</h2>
    <br>
      <p>At the end of the semester project, we presented the results in front of our clients at an exposition. The client was very happy about our redesign and provided some ideas on the prototype for future revisions.</p><br>
      <div class ="flex-row white-bg"><img alt = "process" src = "imgs/ppp/results.jpg"></div><br>
      <p>I was also <b>invited to continue the user testing and revisions</b> with another UX designer in the team.</p><br><br>
    <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">THE LESSON</h3>
    <h2>Understanding stakeholders is as important as understading the users</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Our client is the expert in data and programming, but they do not know much about UX and its process. To ensure the synergy of the whole workgroup, <b>understanding clients' goals and motivations has been euqally vital as understanding the users. </b> Through constant communication and updates, we have had a very positive collaboration experience with out clients by <b>showing them our research methodologies and the reasons behind them, presenting them initial user research findings with elaborated explanation and action plan, as well as displaying the prototype with design rationale.  </b>This is a vluable experience for new projects moving forward, no matter it's another student consulting project or a project at a corporate setting.</p><br><br>
