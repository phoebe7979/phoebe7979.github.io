    <h2>How can the client's existing technology meet code enforcement officers' needs?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      For <b>a semester-based extracurricular UX consulting initiative</b>, I worked in <b>a team of two data scientists and three UX designers</b> to enhance the <a href="http://dynamometrics.com" target="_blank">Dynamo Metrics</a>, a data visualization company. <br><br>
      The company's prospecitve project is a <b>tailor-made data visualization application for the code enforcement team at the City of Jackson</b>. With little UX background and resource, the company is in need of professioal insights to deliver optimal solution. Our deliverables were to <b>conduct user research</b> and <b>provide a mid-fi mockup</b><br><br></p>

    <h2>Keeping only 1/10 of visual elements on the 'neighborhood data' interface</h2><br>
    <p>After a series of user research, I am <b>solely responsible for redesigning the neighborhood data feature</b> of the application. By keeping only the most important elements, I created several mockup pages that illustrate how the new design <b>directs users to the main focus -- the data</b>. Below are the <b>5 key revisions</b> of the application that I contributed:</p>

    <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">THE PROCESS</h3>
    <h2>From zero to final pitch</h2><br>
      <div class ="flex-row white-bg"><img alt = "process" src = "imgs/ppp/process.jpg"></div>
    <br>
    <p>The team has communicated effectively with client upfront to learn their expectations. After the initial meeting, we have learned that <b>the client's biggest hope is to understand the user needs from a UX point of view</b>. We have thus agreed upon delivering a presentation on our findings by the end of the year, while providing mid-fidelity mockups based on our findings for the clients further consideration.</p>


    <br>
    <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">UX RESEARCH</h3>
    <h2>What exactly is code enforcement? Understanding users from a completely unfamiliar field.</h2><br>
    <p>The end users for this projects are very simple -- the Code Enforcement Department of the City of Jackson Government. My teammates and I took several steps to learn about who the users really are, as well as their needs.</p>

    <br>

    <br>

    <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Background Reserach</h5><br>
      <br>
      <p>Without much prior knowledge of both our clients and the users, the whole team conducted a throrough background research by <b>researching the client's past projects, inspecting current software interface, while reading governmental webpages and documents</b> to understand the Code Enforcement Department's various code ordinances they are responsible for.</p><br>
      <div class = "flex-row">
        <div class = "pain-points">
          <h3>"A Code Enforcement Officer is a ... inspector, ... ,employed by a city,..., whose primary duties are the prevention, detection, investigation, and enforcement of violations of laws regulating public nuisance, public health, safety, and welfare, public works, business activities and consumer protection, building standards, land-use, or municipal affairs."<sup>1</sup></h3>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "background" src = "imgs/ppp/backgroundresearch.jpg"></div>
      <p>Aside from understanding related ordinnces, we especially paid attention to the <b>common complaints and violations that code enforcement officers often have to deal with</b>.</p><br>
      <br>
    <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Competitive Analysis</h5><br>
      <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "A blurred screenshot of the competitive analysis" src = "imgs/ppp/competitive.JPG"></div>
      <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "Companies of competitive analysis" src = "imgs/ppp/competitive2.jpg"></div>
      <p>We then proceeded with competitive analysis with five code enforcement related solutions and one other data visuazliation application, for which we examined the following based on public information on their websites: <br></p><br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Platform & supported devices</b></li>
        <li><b>Data types</b></li>
        <li><b>Key workflow</b></li>
        <li><b>UI elements</b></li>
      </ul><br>
      <p>The results showed that <b>most applications are browser-friendly, but whether the content is mobile friendly is unknown </b>(available information all showed desktop view). Considering <b>officers may require access to certain data during their missions on-site</b>, having a mobilt-friendly solution may be useful.</b> </b> In addition, some competitors provide summative data or index. Our client's current application <b>would improve by adding predictive and summative data </b>for users to quickly learn the status of an area. <br><br>As for key workflow, <b>most competitors offer productivity and administrative features</b> aside from data visualization tasks so the users can complete most tasks including issuing permits, file complaints, reporting blights, and update property status; on the other hand, our client's solution specifically focuses on the presentation of city data and only includes functionality to investigate different types of data.<br><br>As for visual presentation and interaction experience, our clients' curernt design incorporates multiple accordions and checkboxes, which result in much visual burden and interaction cost, while wasting quite some space. On the other hand, two competitors utilized floating blocks or hidden features to solve the space issue, providing more real estate for the focus of the application -- the visual presentation of the data.</p>
      <br><br>
    <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">User Interviews</h5><br>
      <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "interview icon" src = "imgs/ppp/interview.png"></div>
      <p><b>Four interviews</b> were conducted at the City of Jackson with potential users in the government. Prior to the interview, the whole team worked together on a semi-structured interview protocol with an aim to elicit specific details regarding the interviewee's <b>background, job responsibilities, daily workflow, challenges, and expectations</b>. </p><br><br>
      <p>After the interview, the UX team interpreted the data and organized the notes into a structured affinity wall, including:</p><br>
      <ul>
      <li>Daily tasks</li>
      <li>Duties</li>
      <li>Issues regarding workflow</li>
      <li>Issues regarding software tools</li>
      <li>Data types in need</li>
      </ul>
      <br><br>
    <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Personas</h5><br>
      <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "A blurred screenshot of the competitive analysis" src = "imgs/ppp/personas.JPG"></div>
      <p>After the interviews, each UX designer developed a persona, each representing a type of the end users: <b>code enforcement director, code enforcement officer, and administrator</b>.</p>
      <br><br>
    <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Workflow</h5><br>
      <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "A blurred screenshot of the competitive analysis" src = "imgs/ppp/workflow.png"></div>
      <p>Prior to the design phase, the UX team developed a <b>flowchart that details the daily routine of the end users</b>. With the help of the flow chart, we were able to efficiently design an interface collaborately.</p>
      <br><br>

    <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">THE RESULTS</h3>
    <h2>The presentation day and an opportunity</h2>
    <br>
      <p>At the end of the semester project, we presented the results in front of our clients at an exposition. The client was very happy about our redesign and provided some ideas on the prototype for future revisions.</p><br>
      <div class ="flex-row white-bg"><img alt = "process" src = "imgs/ppp/results.jpg"></div><br>
      <p>I was also <b>offered a semester-long internship opportunity to continue the user testing and revisions</b> with another UX designer in the team.</p>
