    <h3>Developing an experience for student organization information</h3>
    <br>
    <p>For this design exercise, I am tasked with creating an experience for incoming students at the university to <b>search and browse information about the university's student organization</b>, while being able to <b>propose new student organizations</b>. The final results of the seven-day challenge should be a complete wireframe flow and a page of higher fidelity mockup.
    </p>

    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">The Process</h2>
    <h3>From research to design</h3><br>
    <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "the process diagram" src = "imgs/studentorg/schedule.JPG"></div>
    <p>Upon receiving the prompt, I have laid out a working plan for myself to be able to complete the project on time. Just like other UX projects I have worked on, I started out with background research and user interviews. The final working timeline is presented above.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">Getting Started</h2>
    <h3>Brainstorming and exploration</h3><br>
    <div class= "flex-row"><a href="imgs/studentorg/brainstorm.jpg" data-lightbox="brainstorming" data-title="The Brainstorming Notes"><img src="imgs/studentorg/brainstorm.jpg" alt="cthe brainstorming process"/></a>
    </div>
    <br>

    <p>Since the project revolves around student organizations at the unversity, the first thing I did is to generate as many thoughts and questions about the topic as possible. By listing out my <b>questions and ideas </b>, I have provided myself with a foundation and directions for the UX research later on.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">Comparative Analysis</h2>
    <h3>Searching for the white space</h3><br>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/comparativeanalysis.jpg" data-lightbox="competitive" data-title="Comparative Analysis"><img src="imgs/studentorg/comparativeanalysis.jpg" alt="comparative analysis"/></a>
    </div>
    <p>To familarize myself with exsiting digital solutions for student organization platforms, I conducted a comparative analysis on <b>my <a href = "https://maizepages.umich.edu/organizations" target="_blank">own university</a>, and one large university from the east, the west, the south, and midwest</b> (<a href = "https://osl.fas.harvard.edu/student-organizations" target="_blank">Harvard University</a>, <a href = "https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search" target="_blank">UCLA</a>, <a href = "https://activities.osu.edu/involvement/student_organizations/find_a_student_org/" target="_blank">Ohio State Univesity</a>, and <a href= "https://utdallas.presence.io/organizations" target="_blank">University of Texas at Dallas</a>). In addition, I also included <b>Facebook Group</b> into the comparison in order to explore if there are any better practices when it comes to digital social group experience.
    <br><br>
    I focused my observations on the following issues:</p><br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Browsing organization list</b></li>
      <li><b>Searching for student organizations</b></li>
      <li><b>Registering a student organization</b></li>
      <li><b>What went well?</b></li>
      <li><b>What didn't go well?</b></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h5>STUDENT ORGANIZATION PORTAL</h5>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/comparative/portal.jpg" data-lightbox="page" data-title="Comparative Analysis: Student Organization Portal"><img src="imgs/studentorg/comparative/portal.jpg" alt="comparative analysis"/></a>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>The analysis has shown that:
      <ul>
        <li><b>A lot of the analyzed websites are filled with texts:</b> Without sufficient multimedia elements, the site may not engage users who relies on visual clues or those with short attention span.
        </li>
        <li><b>Some websites do not include events information: </b>Users who are looking for organizations may also be interested in knowing what public events are available.
        </li>
        <li><b>Difficulty to find out how to propose or form an organization on a few sites: </b>For students who wants to be a leader, it may take some interaction efforts to find how to propose a group of their own
        </li>

      </ul></p>
    <br><br>
    <h5>STUDENT ORGANIZATION PAGE</h5>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/comparative/page.jpg" data-lightbox="page" data-title="Comparative Analysis: Student Organization Page"><img src="imgs/studentorg/comparative/page.jpg" alt="comparative analysis"/></a>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>Navigating to each student organization page, I have also noticed the following issues:</p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>No photos:</b> Half of the analyzed websites do not include photos in their student organization page. Readers might still be confused after reading everyting on the page.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Lack of information:</b> Regular meeting times and locations, as well as how to join the organization, are missing on most of the analyzed sites. Even after reaching the organization sites, a student may still be clueless about what's next to get involved.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <h5>REGISTRAIING AN ORGANIZATION</h5>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/comparative/registration.jpg" data-lightbox="page" data-title="Comparative Analysis: Registering New Student Organization"><img src="imgs/studentorg/comparative/registration.jpg" alt="comparative analysis"/></a>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>The registration processes among the analyzed websites differ mostly in their <b>length of text</b>. For students who aspire to become leaders, it takes a while for them to get started to propose their ideas.

    </p>
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">Interviews</h2>
    <h3>Digging into other students' experience</h3><br>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/protocol.JPG" data-lightbox="interview" data-title="Interview Protocol"><img src="imgs/studentorg/protocol.JPG" alt="interview-protocol"/></a>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <p>Concurrent with comparative analysis, I also conducted <b>5 semi-structured interviews</b> with students from both undergrad and graduate schools. My <b>overarching question was 'How does the interviewee go about learning and get involved with student organizations?'</b> The interview protocol was then desgined to explore the topic with 10 pre-designed questions and varied follow-ups.
     </p>
    <br>
    <p>From the interview, I was able to determine the journey of different types of users, and develop personas and scenarios.</p>
    <br><br>

    <h5>PERSONAS</h5>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/persona1.JPG" class = "graphics-img" data-lightbox="persona" data-title="Persona"><img src="imgs/studentorg/persona1.JPG" alt="persona"/></a>
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/persona2.JPG" class = "graphics-img" data-lightbox="persona" data-title="Persona"><img src="imgs/studentorg/persona2.JPG" alt="persona"/></a>
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/persona3.JPG" class = "graphics-img" data-lightbox="persona" data-title="Persona"><img src="imgs/studentorg/persona3.JPG" alt="persona"/></a>
    </div>
    <h5>SCENARIOS</h5>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/scenario1.jpg" class = "graphics-img" data-lightbox="scenario" data-title="Scenario"><img src="imgs/studentorg/scenario1.jpg" alt="scenario"/></a>
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/scenario2.jpg" class = "graphics-img" data-lightbox="scenario" data-title="Scenario"><img src="imgs/studentorg/scenario2.jpg" alt="scenario"/></a>
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/scenario3.jpg" class = "graphics-img" data-lightbox="scenario" data-title="Ccenario"><img src="imgs/studentorg/scenario3.jpg" alt="persona"/></a>
    </div>
    <p>The personas and scenarios illustrate three different user types that I have observed from the interviews: the leader, the fun-lover, and the busy student. However, there is another user type that I should also take into consideration during the design: the observer. These people are most likely the prospective students who would browse the webstie to learn more about school information and campus life. For them, it's not about whether or not to join or run a student organization, but rather to learn about what it is like to learn and become a part of the university community. </p>
