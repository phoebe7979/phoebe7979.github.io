    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">The Project</h2>
    <h3>Developing an experience for student organization information</h3>
    <br>
    <p>For this design exercise, I am tasked with creating an experience for incoming students at the university to <b>search and browse information about the university's student organization</b>, while being able to <b>propose new student organizations</b>. The final results of the seven-day challenge should be a complete wireframe flow and a page of higher fidelity mockup.
    </p>

    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">The Process</h2>
    <h3>From research to design</h3><br>
    <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "the process diagram" src = "imgs/studentorg/schedule.JPG"></div>
    <p>Upon receiving the prompt, I have laid out a working plan for myself to be able to complete the project on time. Just like other UX projects I have worked on, I started out with background research and user interviews. The final working timeline is presented above.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">Getting Started</h2>
    <h3>Brainstorming and exploration</h3><br>
    <div class= "flex-row"><a href="imgs/studentorg/brainstorm.jpg" data-lightbox="brainstorming" data-title="The Brainstorming Notes"><img src="imgs/studentorg/brainstorm.jpg" alt="cthe brainstorming process"/></a>
    </div>
    <br>

    <p>Since the project revolves around student organizations at the unversity, the first thing I did is to generate as many thoughts and questions about the topic as possible. By listing out my <b>questions and ideas </b>, I have provided myself with a foundation and directions for the UX research later on.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">Comparative Analysis</h2>
    <h3>Searching for the white space</h3><br>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/comparativeanalysis.jpg" data-lightbox="competitive" data-title="Comparative Analysis"><img src="imgs/studentorg/comparativeanalysis.jpg" alt="comparative analysis"/></a>
    </div>
    <p>To familarize myself with exsiting digital solutions for student organization platforms, I conducted a comparative analysis on <b>my <a href = "https://maizepages.umich.edu/organizations" target="_blank">own university</a>, and one large university from the east, the west, the south, and midwest</b> (<a href = "https://osl.fas.harvard.edu/student-organizations" target="_blank">Harvard University</a>, <a href = "https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search" target="_blank">UCLA</a>, <a href = "https://activities.osu.edu/involvement/student_organizations/find_a_student_org/" target="_blank">Ohio State Univesity</a>, and <a href= "https://utdallas.presence.io/organizations" target="_blank">University of Texas at Dallas</a>). In addition, I also included <b>Facebook Group</b> into the comparison in order to explore if there are any better practices when it comes to digital social group experience.
    <br><br>
    I focused my observations on the following issues:</p><br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Browsing organization list</b></li>
      <li><b>Searching for student organizations</b></li>
      <li><b>Registering a student organization</b></li>
      <li><b>What went well?</b></li>
      <li><b>What didn't go well?</b></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h5>STUDENT ORGANIZATION PORTAL</h5>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/comparative/portal.JPG" data-lightbox="page" data-title="Comparative Analysis: Student Organization Portal"><img src="imgs/studentorg/comparative/portal.JPG" alt="comparative analysis"/></a>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>The analysis has shown that:
      <ul>
        <li><b>A lot of the analyzed websites are filled with texts:</b> Without sufficient multimedia elements, the site may not engage users who relies on visual clues or those with short attention span.
        </li>
        <li><b>Some websites do not include events information: </b>Users who are looking for organizations may also be interested in knowing what public events are available.
        </li>
        <li><b>Difficulty to find out how to propose or form an organization on a few sites: </b>For students who wants to be a leader, it may take some interaction efforts to find how to propose a group of their own
        </li>

      </ul></p>
    <br><br>
    <h5>STUDENT ORGANIZATION PAGE</h5>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/comparative/page.JPG" data-lightbox="page" data-title="Comparative Analysis: Student Organization Page"><img src="imgs/studentorg/comparative/page.JPG" alt="comparative analysis"/></a>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>Navigating to each student organization page, I have also noticed the following issues:</p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>No photos:</b> Half of the analyzed websites do not include photos in their student organization page. Readers might still be confused after reading everyting on the page.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Lack of information:</b> Regular meeting times and locations, as well as how to join the organization, are missing on most of the analyzed sites. Even after reaching the organization sites, a student may still be clueless about what's next to get involved.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <h5>REGISTRAIING AN ORGANIZATION</h5>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/comparative/registration.jpg" data-lightbox="page" data-title="Comparative Analysis: Registering New Student Organization"><img src="imgs/studentorg/comparative/registration.jpg" alt="comparative analysis"/></a>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>The registration processes among the analyzed websites differ mostly in their <b>length of text</b>. For students who aspire to become leaders, it takes a while for them to get started to propose their ideas.

    </p>
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">Interviews</h2>
    <h3>Digging into other students' experience</h3><br>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/protocol.JPG" data-lightbox="interview" data-title="Interview Protocol"><img src="imgs/studentorg/protocol.JPG" alt="interview-protocol"/></a>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <p>Concurrent with comparative analysis, I also conducted <b>5 semi-structured interviews</b> with students from both undergrad and graduate schools. My <b>overarching question was 'How does the interviewee go about learning and get involved with student organizations?'</b> The interview protocol was then desgined to explore the topic with 10 pre-designed questions and varied follow-ups. Some pain points the interviewee have expressed include:
     </p>
     <div class = "flex-row">
       <div class = "pain-points">
         <h3>If the webpage has too many words, I will just close it.</h3>
       </div>
       <div class = "pain-points">
         <h3>I usually just skim through different clubs before making a decision.</h3>
       </div>
       <div class = "pain-points">
         <h3>Sometimes even with the description it's still unclear what the student club is doing.</h3>
       </div>
       <div class = "pain-points">
         <h3>I want to know what student organizations other people participate, so I can ask them what they think before consdering joining or not.</h3>
       </div>
       <div class = "pain-points">
         <h3>I want to see what the participation requirements are so I don't cause people trouble.</h3>
       </div>
       <div class = "pain-points">
         <h3>I want to know what the members are like so I know if we can possibly get along.</h3>
       </div>
     </div>
    <br>
    <p>From the interview, I was able to determine the journey of different types of users, and develop personas and scenarios.</p>
    <br><br>

    <h5>PERSONAS</h5>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/persona1.JPG" class = "graphics-img" data-lightbox="persona" data-title="Persona"><img src="imgs/studentorg/persona1.JPG" alt="persona"/></a>
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/persona2.JPG" class = "graphics-img" data-lightbox="persona" data-title="Persona"><img src="imgs/studentorg/persona2.JPG" alt="persona"/></a>
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/persona3.JPG" class = "graphics-img" data-lightbox="persona" data-title="Persona"><img src="imgs/studentorg/persona3.JPG" alt="persona"/></a>
    </div>
    <h5>SCENARIOS</h5>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/scenario1.jpg" class = "graphics-img" data-lightbox="scenario" data-title="Scenario"><img src="imgs/studentorg/scenario1.jpg" alt="scenario"/></a>
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/scenario2.jpg" class = "graphics-img" data-lightbox="scenario" data-title="Scenario"><img src="imgs/studentorg/scenario2.jpg" alt="scenario"/></a>
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/scenario3.jpg" class = "graphics-img" data-lightbox="scenario" data-title="Ccenario"><img src="imgs/studentorg/scenario3.jpg" alt="persona"/></a>
    </div>
    <p>The personas and scenarios illustrate three different user types that I have observed from the interviews: the leader, the fun-lover, and the busy student.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>The leader:</b> As a change-maker, she will look for ways to form her own organization after browsing existing ones.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The fun-lover:</b> For him, getting involved in student organizations is about building friendship and creating fun memories.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The busy student:</b> Busy as she is, she pays extra attention in membership requirements and meeting times. She would prefer to join public events before considering becoming a member.
        </li>
      </ul>

    </p>

    <br><br>
    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">Design Goals and Considerations</h2>
    <h3>Engage, Enrich, Connect</h3><br>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/designconsiderations.JPG" data-lightbox="guidance" data-title="Design Considerations"><img src="imgs/studentorg/designconsiderations.JPG" alt="Design Considerations"/></a>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <p>After the research, a direction for the UX design has been determined. My design goal is to create a web experience that helps student <b>engage in college activities, enrich their campus life, and connect with other people</b>. In order to reach the goal, I listed down several considerations generated from both comparative analysis and user interviews.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">Iterations</h2>
    <h3>Multiple phases of design and user testings</h3><br>
    <div class = "flex-row">
        <a href="imgs/studentorg/sketches.jpg" data-lightbox="sketches" data-title="Sketches"><img src="imgs/studentorg/sketches.jpg" alt="Initial Sketches"/></a>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>I started out with some sketches before delving into wireframing design. Parallel with the wireframing design, I also conducted <b>user testings with 2 previous interviewees and 2 other people who has no previous knowledge of the proejct</b>. Based on the restuls and feedback gathered from user testing, I have made several changes to the design.
    </p>

    <h5>REVISION ON THE ENGAGEMENT HUB PORTAL</h5>
    <br>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/changes/portal.jpg" data-lightbox="changes" data-title="Design changes - Engagement Hub Portal"><img src="imgs/studentorg/changes/portal.jpg" alt="Design changes - Engagement Hub Portal"/></a>

    </div>
    <br>
    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">Final Design</h2>
    <h3>The Student Engagement Hub</h3><br>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/wireframe.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="imgs/studentorg/wireframe.jpg" alt="wireflow"/></a>
    </div><br><br>
    <p></p>The final design is the Student Engement Hub that includes 21 wireframes. The page includes three main features:
    <br>
    <br>
    <h5>THE LANDING PAGE</h5>
    <br>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/PortalLandingPage.png" target="_blank" ><img src="imgs/studentorg/PortalLandingPage.png" alt="Portal Langing Page"/></a>
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/PortalLandingPage-Logged.png" target="_blank" ><img src="imgs/studentorg/PortalLandingPage-Logged.png" alt="Portal Langing Page - After Logging In"/></a>
    </div>
    <p>The landing page has two version: <b>visitor mode</b> and <b>logged-in mode</b>. The visitor mode inludes <b>upcoming events, recommended organization categories, and exploring student organizations by category name</b>. After users log in their accounts, the page has two addition sections on the top: <b>What's New</b> and <b>My Organizations</b>. The decision to make different mode came from a suggestion gathered from user testing: by presenting information in different modes, the page can cater to different ktypes of user needs.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h5>THE ORGANIZATION PAGE</h5>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/OrgPage.png" target="_blank" ><img src="imgs/studentorg/OrgPage.png" alt="Organization Page"/></a>
    </div>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/OrgPage-PhotosViewAll.png" data-lightbox="orgpage" data-title="Wireflow"><img src="imgs/studentorg/OrgPage-PhotosViewAll.png" alt="Organization Page-View all Photos"/></a>
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/OrgPage-MembersViewAll.png" data-lightbox="orgpage" data-title="Wireflow"><img src="imgs/studentorg/OrgPage-MembersViewAll.png" alt="Organization Page-View all Members"/></a>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>The organization page includes the category, social media and external link for existing official website, introduction, photos, membership details, people, a documentation tab, an upcoming event block with functionality to see other events, and a newsletter subscription button. <b>Considering users' preference to skim through content while learning about an organization, I decided to put most information on the same page to reduce interaction cost. </b>In addition, <b>adding the photos on the home page instead of putting it in a different tab helps providing a balance</b> between visual aids and text to engage users.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h5>THE PROPOSAL EXPERIENCE</h5>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/PortalLandingPage-SearchResults.png" target="_blank" ><img src="imgs/studentorg/PortalLandingPage-SearchResults.png" alt="Search Results Page"/></a>
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/PortalLandingPage-Organization.png" target="_blank" ><img src="imgs/studentorg/PortalLandingPage-Organization.png" alt="Organization Tab on Portal"/></a>
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/ProposeAnOrg.png" target="_blank" ><img src="imgs/studentorg/ProposeAnOrg.png" alt="Propose an organization"/></a>
    </div>
<br>
    <p>There are two places where a user can be prompted to propose a new organization: at the end of the search results, and in the 'Organizations' tab. The first location encourages those who do not find their ideal organization on campus to run one of their own. The second is the main directory where general intersted students can start a new organization proposal. </p>
  <br>
    <div class ="flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/ProposeAnOrg-Start1.png" class = "graphics-img" data-lightbox="propose" data-title="Propose an Organization Step 1"><img src="imgs/studentorg/ProposeAnOrg-Start1.png" alt="Propose an organization step 1"/></a>
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/ProposeAnOrg-Start4.png" class = "graphics-img" data-lightbox="propose" data-title="Propose an Organization Step 4"><img src="imgs/studentorg/ProposeAnOrg-Start4.png" alt="Propose an organization step 4"/></a>
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/ProposeAnOrg-Start6.png" class = "graphics-img" data-lightbox="propose" data-title="Propose an Organization Step 6"><img src="imgs/studentorg/ProposeAnOrg-Start6.png" alt="Propose an organization step 6"/></a>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>To facilitate the proposal process, I broke down the proposal page into several pages, and utilize the account system of the website to digitize the traditional signing paperwork.</p><br>
    <h5>HIGH FIDELITY MOCKUP</h5>
    <div class = "flex-row">
      <a href="imgs/studentorg/hifi.png" target="_blank" ><img src="imgs/studentorg/hifi.png" alt="Search Results Page"/></a>
    </div><br><br>
    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">What I learned</h2>
    <h3>Don't do it alone</h3><br>
    <p>Throughout the whole design process, I have found user interviews and testings the most valuable steps. By observingg others interact with my design and asking for their feedback, I have generated a lot more design ideas and made better decisions than I would alone. </p>
