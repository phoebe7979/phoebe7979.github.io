    <h2>An urgent need to update the museum website</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      During the spring break, I participated in UMSI's five-day long Alternative Spring Break initiative, which is purported to contriute and make positive impact on the local communities with informational services.<br><br>
      Our client was the Hellenic Museum of Michigan, which is a volunteer-initiated non-profit organization that aims to treasure and promote the Greek culture in the Greater Detroit area and other regions in Michigan.<br><br>
      The museum's current website was built on a software that is no longer updated. With only one volunteer in charge of maintaining the website, the museum website is in urgent need for a new experience. Now that the museum has been under renovation, we were tasked to build a new website before the museum reopens again.</p>
      <div class ="flex-row">
        <img src = "imgs/hellenic/screenshot_old.jpg" alt="old website of the museum">

    <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">THE RESULT</h3>
    <h2>A newly designed website experience on a easily manageable CMS</h2><br>
    <p>After four working days, our team conducted user research, re-scoped and communicated the solution, and delivered a completely developed new website using Squarespace, a CMS that is easy to manage.<br><br>
    The new website includes eight different pages. </p>
    <br><br>
    <div class="slidetext-multi">
        <h2>Index</h2><br>
        <h4>Before: </h4>
        <p>Lack of entrance information confused users when planning for a visit.
        Long introductory paragraph did not engage users.</p><br><br><br>
        <h4>After: </h4>
        <p>The most prominent area is dedicated to the entrance information, following by a section for promoted exhibition. A call-to-action button is added to both sections to increase user interaction. Social media plug-ins display real-time updates. At the footer, there's an added menu for users' quicker navigation.<br>

    <p>The volunteering project was very short. In order to bring value to the client, we took the challenge to <b>go beyond prototype</b> and actully built a website that could be immediately deployed by the museum.<br><br>

    <h2>Gathering data for design direction</h2><br>
    <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Stakeholder Interviews</h5><br>
    <br>
    <p>We began the project by holding several interivews with <b>stakeholders</b> and <b>potential users</b>. In the orientation meeting, we met theree different roles of the museum to understand their expectations. <br><br>
    </p>
    <div class = "flex-row">
      <img src = "imgs/hellenic/stakeholder.png" alt = "stakeholder expectations">
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">User Interviews</h5><br><br>
    <p>To understand user needs, we also conducted two interviews with potential visitors of the museum. Aside from understanding their motivations and possible usae scenarios, we also performed a <b>user test using think-aloud protocol</b> where the interviewees completeed tasks in assigned scenarios on the previous site to see their impression on the browsing experience.<br><br>
    The interview protocol can be downloaded <a href = "imgs/protocol.pdf" target="_blank">here.</p><br><br></a>
    <p>After the user interview, we conducted an affinity analysis to systemize data about user behaviors and attitudes on the previous website.</p><br><br>
    <div class = "flex-row">
      <a href = "imgs/hellenic/affinity.jpg"><img src = "imgs/hellenic/affinity.jpg" alt = "affinity wall"/></a>
    </div>
    <p>Issues brought up by both users were broken links on the index page, lack of ticket information and exhibition details. Users were also not impressed by the visual presentation.</p>
    <div class = "flex-row">
      <div class = "pain-points">
        <h5>They did a really good job hiding that (exhibition details).</h5>

        <h5>The style feels outdated and there is too many texts.</h5>
      </div><br>

    <br><br>
  <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Comparative Analysis</h5><br><br>
  <p>We also compared five other museum websites of different sizes, two with immigration theme like our client, to see how they present their information. Our key learnings are:
  <ul>
    <li>Showing tickets/opening hours and prices at the top of the index page</li>
    <li>Detailed information should be provided for exhibition</li>
    <li>Content should be image rich so visitors know what to expect</li>
  </ul></p>

    <img src = "imgs/hellenic/comparative.png" alt = "Compared websites">
  </div>

    <h2>Re-scoping the project and deciding on the structure</h2><br>
    <p>After the research, we were overwhelmed by how many items needed to be done. To completely fulfill user needs, the content of the website would have to be thoroughly researched, discussed and drafted to provide most valuable information for the users. With less than 3 working days left, we needed to decide on what tasks to be kept, and what should be set aside. <br><br>
    After balancing stakeholder needs and user needs, we decided to provide an immediately viable and scalable framework of the website.<br><br>
    Each of us first brainstormed the new organization of the website, and we were surprised to find that our organizations were very similar. By combining our versions, we presented the sitemap structure to our client in an update meeting, which was approved to proceed.</p>

  <h2>Realizing ideas to a functional website</h2><br><br>
  <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Rapid Wireframing</h5><br><br>
  <p>We started the design by working on different pages individually. After 15 minutes of rapid sketching, we presented our wireframes of responsible pages to each other.</p>
  <div class = "flex-row">
    <div class="slideimage-multi">

    <h6>Wireframe sketch for programs page</h6>
  </div>
  <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Build and Test</h5><br><br>
  <p>We spent the last two working days on translting ideas from the wireframs to actual website. Instead of prototyping first, we decided to directly build the final product on Squarespace due to time constraint. A style guide was developed directly on Squarespace with the following color palette.<br><br></p>
  <div class ="flex-row">
      <img src = "imgs/hellenic/color.png" alt="color palette"><br>
  </div><br><br>
  <p>Throughout the process, we made some design changes from our initial sitemap plan.<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Separate 'Exhibitions' and 'Programs' tab to encourage program visibility. (The program pages were taken down in the final version because the clients would like to revise the program details.)</li>
    <li>Remove the 'Contact Us' subpage from 'About', because the content is similar to 'Plan a Visit', and because the contact information should always made accessible at the footer.</li>
    <li>Changed the upcoming events from calendar view to list view, because there was no new event in March, and this could confuse users.</li>
