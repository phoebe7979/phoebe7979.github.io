    <h2>Why does in-store grocery shopping have to take that much time?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Grocery shopping is a recurring task that almost no household could excape. However, not everyone enjoys doing it.</p><br>
  </div>
  <div class = "flex-row">
    <div class = "pain-points">
      <h3>I almost always ended up spending much more time than I wanted shopping at the grocery store.</h3>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class = "project-content-text">
    <p>According to The Time Use Institute (2008) survey, <b>US shoppers spend an hour per week shopping for groceries.</b> As time-consuming as it seems, <b>in-store grocery shopping is still preferred over online shopping by 92% of shoppers in the US </b> (ICSC,2018). Undoubtedly, shopping in physical stores allows one to have more control of what he/she gets -- you can handpick the freshest looking produce, or spot special deals that are not listed online. But what about control over time and budget? In fact, based on the results of a small-scaled questionnaire with 16 participants, <b>10 out of 16 people reported to have often or always stayed longer than they expected shopping for groceries.</b> Is there a way to make in-store grocery shopping enjoyable yet efficient? <br><br></p>
    <div class = "flex-row">
      <img src = "imgs/grogo/problem.png" alt="the problem"/>
    </div>
    <p>For the <b>individual project of the course Interaction Design</b>, I aimed to design a solution that streamlines grocery shopping expeirence, helping <b>in-store shoppers manage time and money more effectively during their shopping routines.</b></p>
    <br>
    <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">THE FINAL DESIGN</h3>
    <h2>groGo - A planner, a trainer, and a navigator</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The final solution is a mobile application -- groGo, which <b>targets in-store grocery shoppers who wish their shopping trips could be more efficient</b>. From grocery planning to expense tracking, the solution will serve as <b>a planner, a trainer, and a navigator throughout the whole grocery journey</b>. Unlike most other products on the market, it <b>does not restrict itself to any specific grocery store</b>, but instead leverages its powerful database that integrates product information across different grocery brands.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Key features of groGo includes:</p>

    <h2>What do people have to say about their shopping experience? What are the solutions out there that cope smilar problems?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>In order to understand people's pain points doing grocery shopping, I collected and analyzed both quantitative and qualitative data for further ideation.</p><br>

      <br>
        <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Small Sample Survey</h5><br>
        <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "sample questions of the survey" src = "imgs/grogo/survey.JPG"></div>
        <p>A short user needs survey was conducted online to learn the in-store shoppers' challenges. The reponses from five-point Likert scaled questions showed that <b>10 out of 16 people reported to have often or always stayed longer than they expetected shopping for groceries </b>. Additionally, three problems have often or always happened to more than half of the 10 respondents during their shopping expereince: </p><br><br>

            <img src = "imgs/grogo/return.png" alt = "return icon"/><br>
            <h4>Forgetting about an item</h4><br>
            <h5>Having to return to previous aisles because of missing an item, therefore spending much more time.</h5>
          </div>
          <div class = "third-block"><br>
            <img src = "imgs/grogo/cursor.png" alt = "navigation icon"/><br>
            <h4>Locating an item is hard</h4><br>
            <h5>Even with aisle information displayed in the store or on the mobile app, it's hard to find the exact item in the aisle.</h5>
          </div>
          <div class = "third-block"><br>
            <img src = "imgs/grogo/magnifying.png" alt = "magnifying glassicon"/><br>
            <h4>Checking labels is tedious</h4><br>
            <h5>Because of personal dietary preference, it's easy to spend a lot of time comparing similar products.</h5>
          </div>
        </div>

        <br><br>
        <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">User Interviews</h5><br>
        <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "interview icon" src = "imgs/grogo/interview.png"></div>
        <p>In addition to the survey, I also <b>interviewed four different shoppers</b> individually. By <b>having them walk me through their last grocery shopping experience</b>, I have come to understand that not everyone is looking for efficient shopping: for example, one of the interviewee described how she actually indulges herself spending quite some time browsing grocery items in store, because that is one of the few enjoyments she could have living a busy life. Other quotations gathered from the interview includes: </p><br>
        <div class = "flex-row">
          <div class = "pain-points">
            <h3>Shopping really takes too much time..especially when I have to wait for the bus.</h3>
          </div>
          <div class = "pain-points">
            <h3>My husband is vegetarian, so I have to pay extra attention to what I buy.</h3>
          </div>
          <div class = "pain-points">
            <h3>I have trouble finding a particular item.</h3>

          <div class = "pain-points">

          <div class = "pain-points">
            <h3>I am buying much more than needed...I wish I could just not spend too much money</h3>

        </div>
        <p>Aside from preliminary user research, I also examined existing products on the markets, including grocery stores' mobile applications, as well as to-do list and meal prep apps. From the analysis, I noticed that <b>grocery store apps have less sophisticated planning features, while meal prep apps or to-do list apps rarely include specific product information</b>. The results implied a possible solution that includes the good of both application types. </p><br><br>

        <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">DEFINE AND SCOPE</h3>
        <h2>Setting up design objective and goals</h2>
        <p>To synthesize the research and interview findings, I have collected some major issues  during grocery shopping and determined the goal of the design:</p>
        <br><br>
        <div class = "flex-row">
          <div class = "third-block"><br><br>
            <img src = "imgs/grogo/piggy-bank.png" alt = "phone icon"/><br>
            <h4>Time & Money Saving</h4><br>
            <h5>Help shoppers quickly make efficient and budget-minded purchase decisions.</h5>
          </div>
          <div class = "third-block"><br>
            <img src = "imgs/grogo/connection.png" alt = "calendar icon"/><br>
            <h4>Non Store-Specific</h4><br>
            <h5>Should incorporate data from multiple stores instead of a single brand.</h5>
          </div>
          <div class = "third-block"><br>
            <img src = "imgs/grogo/customer.png" alt = "setting icon"/><br>
            <h4>Record Dietary Preference</h4><br>
            <h5>Identify suitable choices for shoppers to reach dietary goals.</h5>
          </div>
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">Personas & Scenarios</h5><br><br>
          <p>From the user research, I developed a set of different personas for reference during the design. I then envisioned how the <b>primary, secondary, and supplemental personas</b> would use the final product in theri respective scenarios.</p>

With the help of the ingredient scanner, she also dodges a few high-carb items that are on the list, and opts for lower ones.  <br><br>
                      Coming home, Brianne feels happy that she has a good start of the day. She completes her shopping 20 minutes sooner than before, and earns an exciting coupon just because of that. ‘Time is money’, she firmly believes it.<br><br>

      <h2>How would the solution make my users happy and efficient shoppers?</h2>

        <br>
          <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">Brainstorming</h5><br><br>
          <p>Before deciding on designing a mobile app, I started to brainstorm <b>as many potential solutions as possible</b>, no matter whether the solution already exists on market or not. For example, one potential solution is pickup service, where users can select desired items prior to their shopping trips and pick up groceries once they arrive. This solution balances users' need for saving time and having fresher food, but the incurred service fee may not save shoppers money. Some other brainstormed solutions include <b>hired shopper service, smart shopping cart, digital shelves, and interactive infomation wall at store</b>. <br><br>
          In the end, I have considered user needs and contraints, and opted for designing 'groGo'-- a mobile app that serves as a one-stop soltution for in-store shoppers. The considerations are as follows:</p><br><br>
          <div class = "flex-row">
            <div class = "third-block"><br>
              <img src = "imgs/grogo/smartphone.png" alt = "phone icon"/><br>
              <h4>Accessibility</h4><br>
              <h5>Other solutions requires services fee or depend on the availability of the hardware devices. </h5>
            </div>
            <div class = "third-block"><br><br>
              <img src = "imgs/grogo/calendar.png" alt = "calendar icon"/><br>
              <h4>Development Time</h4><br>
              <h5>Some solutions require participation from different grocery brands. It may take more time for them to be launched.</h5>
            </div>
            <div class = "third-block"><br>
              <img src = "imgs/grogo/settings.png" alt = "setting icon"/><br>
              <h4>Maintenance</h4><br>
              <h5>Higher cost for solutions such as smart shopping cart, digital shelves, and interactive information walls.</h5>
            </div>
          </div>
          <br><br>
          <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">Storyboards</h5><br><br>
          <p>I then utilized <b>storyboards</b> to <b>visualize possible usage scenarios</b> for each possible feature on the app.</p><br>
          <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "story board" src = "imgs/grogo/storyboard.png">
          </div><br><br>
          <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">Storymaps</h5><br><br>
          <br>
          <p>In order to conduct <b>more detailed tasks analysis for each persona concerning how they would use groGo, </b>I developed a series of <b>storymaps</b> for each persona, each includes three layers: activities, tasks, and subtasks. <br><br></p>
          <div class = "flex-row">
          <a href="imgs/grogo/storymap1.JPG" class = "graphics-img" data-lightbox="storymap" data-title="Story Map for Primary Persona"><img src="imgs/grogo/storymap1.JPG" class = "graphics-img" alt="Story Map for Primary Persona"/></a>
          <a href="imgs/grogo/storymap2.JPG" class = "graphics-img" data-lightbox="storymap" data-title="Story Map for Secondary Persona"><img src="imgs/grogo/storymap2.JPG" class = "graphics-img" alt="Story Map for Secondary Persona"/></a>
          <a href="imgs/grogo/storymap3.JPG" class = "graphics-img" data-lightbox="storymap" data-title="Story Map for Supplemental Persona"><img src="imgs/grogo/storymap3.JPG" class = "graphics-img" alt="sStory Map for Supplemental Persona"/></a>
          </div>
          <p>From these maps, I am able to distill a <b>common path</b>, which allows me to further develope a <b>more granular architecture</b> of the mobile appplication.</p><br>
          <div class ="flex-row">
            <a href="imgs/grogo/storymap.jpg" data-lightbox="commonpath" data-title="The Common Path for the Story Map"><img src="imgs/grogo/storymap.jpg"  alt="common path"/></a>
          </div>
          </div>
        <div class = "project-content-text">
          <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">Usage Flow</h5><br>
          <div class = "flex-row">
            <a href="imgs/grogo/flow_chart.png" data-lightbox="flowchart" data-title="Flowchart"><img src="imgs/grogo/flow_chart.png"  alt="application flow chart"/></a>
          </div>
          <p>With the <b>story maps</b> as guidance, I was then able to systemize the features in the form of an <b>information architecture flow chart</b>. With such visualization as guidance, the scope of the product were made much clearer. <br><br>
          In addition, the flow chart allows me to <b>identify and include different use cases</b> for the application, while <b>determining which features should be made the most accessible on the interface</b>. From the flow chart, I have identified <b>four most frequently used features to be displayed at the most salient places on the app interface: search, shopping list, scanner, and GO mode.</b> These features were mentioned as the <b>first few steps in the persona's scenarios</b>.</p><br><br>
      <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">PROTOTYPE</h3>
      <h2>Translating ideas to assessible design</h2>
        <br><br>
          <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">Paper Prototype</h5><br>
          <div class ="flex-row"><img src = "imgs/grogo/paper.gif" alt = "paper prototype"/></div>
          <p>Before delving into digital prototype, a <b>paper-based prototype model</b> was first created to allow quick user testing and conceptualization. <br><br>
          To make design decisions, I adopted the <b>QOC analysis</b> method, as shown below.</p><br>

          <div class ="flex-row">
            <a href="imgs/grogo/qoc.JPG" data-lightbox="QOC" data-title="QOC Diagram"><img src="imgs/grogo/qoc.JPG" alt="QOC Diagram"/></a>
          </div>
          <br><br>
          <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">User Testing</h5><br>
          <div class ="flex-row"><img src = "imgs/grogo/testing.png" alt = "user testing"/></div>
          <br>
          <p>After it's done, the paper prototype has undergone 6 user testing sessions. Based on user feedback, I have made several improvements:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><b>Changed the name</b> of some features to avoid confision, e.g., 'item group' --> 'favorites'.</li>
          <li>Changed design for <b>scalability consideration</b>, e.g., use carousel presentation for frequently visited stores.</li>
          <li><b>Changed visual affordances</b> such as icon size to improve usability.</li>
          </ul>
          <br><br>

          <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">Digital Prototype</h5><br>
          <div class ="flex-row">
            <a href = "imgs/grogo/homeprocess.png" target = "_blank"><img src = "imgs/grogo/homeprocess.png" alt = "homepage iteration process"/></a>
            <a href = "imgs/grogo/searchprocess.png" target = "_blank"><img src = "imgs/grogo/searchprocess.png" alt = "search restuls iteration process"/></a>
            <a href = "imgs/grogo/mapprocess.png" target = "_blank"><img src = "imgs/grogo/mapprocess.png" alt = "in-store map iteration process"/></a>
          </div>

          <div class ="flex-row"></div>
          <p>I have iterated multiple times working on the digital prototype, <b>each time followed by a brief user testing on certain task</b> for further feedback and usability check.
          <br><br>
