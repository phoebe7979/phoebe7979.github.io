  <div class = "project-content-text">
    <p>According to The Time Use Institute (2008) survey, <b>US shoppers spend an hour per week
shopping for groceries.</b> As time-consuming as it seems, <b>in-store grocery shopping is still preferred over online shopping by 92% of shoppers in the US </b> (ICSC,2018). <br><br>
For the <b>individual final project of the course Interaction Design</b>, I aimed to design a solution that <b>streamlines grocery shopping in physical stores.</b> </p>
    <br>
    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">The Design</h2>
    <h3>A planner, a trainer, and a navigator</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The final solution is a mobile application -- groGo, which <b>targets in-store grocery shoppers who wish their shopping trips could be more efficient</b>. From grocery planning to expense tracking, the solution will serve as <b>a planner, a trainer, and a navigator throughout the whole grocery journey</b>. Unlike most other products on the market, it <b>does not restrict itself to any specific grocery store</b>, but instead leverages its powerful database that integrates product information across different grocery brands.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The application is designed to address multiple pain points with <b>5 key features</b>.</p>

        <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "sample questions of the survey" src = "imgs/grogo/survey.JPG"></div>
        <p>A short user needs survey was conducted online to learn the in-store shoppers' challenges. The reponses from five-point Likert scaled questions showed that <b>10 out of 16 people reported to have often or always stayed longer than they expetected shopping for groceries </b>. Additionally, three problems have often or always happened to more than half of the 10 respondents during their shopping expereince: </p><br>
        <ul>
        <li>Having to return to previous aisles because of <b>missing an item</b></li>
        <li>Having <b>difficulty locating an item</b> in the store</li>

        <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "interview icon" src = "imgs/grogo/interview.png"></div>
        <p>In addition to the survey, I also <b>interviewed four different shoppers</b> individually. By <b>having them walk me through their last grocery shopping experience</b>, I have come to understand that not everyone is looking for efficient shopping: for example, one of the interviewee described how she actually indulges herself spending quite some time browsing grocery items in store, because that is one of the few enjoyments she could have living a busy life. Some of the new findings that emerged from the interviews are: </p><br>
        <ul>
        <li>Shoppers who only shop for themselves are <b>buying much more than needed</b></li>
        <li>Some shoppers would choose to shop online once a while because there is a promotion</li>
        <li>One shopper has a different diet from her husband, and would thus have to <b>pay extra attention to food labels</b> during shopping</li></ul>

        <h3>3. Competitive Analysis</h3><br>
        <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "competitive analysis" src = "imgs/grogo/competitive.JPG"></div>
        <p>Aside from preliminary user research, I also examined existing products on the markets, including grocery stores' mobile applications, as well as to-do list and meal prep apps. From the analysis, I noticed that <b>grocery store apps have less sophisticated planning features, while meal prep apps or to-do list apps rarely include specific product information</b>. The results implied a possible solution that includes the good of both application types. </p><br><br>

      <br>
      <p>From ideas to final prototype, the design process includes several steps:</p><br>

      <div class = "flex-row">
        <button class = "project-step-btn" id="design-process-btn-1">Brainstorming</button>

      </div>
      <br>
      <div class = "project-step-row" id="design-process-row-1">
        <h3>1. Brainstorming</h3><br>
        <p>Before deciding on designing a mobile app, I started to brainstorm <b>as many potential solutions as possible</b>, no matter whether the solution already exists on market or not. For example, one potential solution is pickup service, where users can select desired items prior to their shopping trips and pick up groceries once they arrive. This solution balances users' need for saving time and having fresher food, but the incurred service fee may not save shoppers money. Some other brainstormed solutions include <b>hired shopper service, smart shopping cart, digital shelves, and interactive infomation wall at store</b>. <br><br>
        In the end, I have considered user needs and contraints, and opted for designing 'groGo'-- a mobile app that serves as a one-stop soltution for in-store shoppers.</p><br><br>
        <p>I then utilized <b>storyboards</b> to gain better knowledge of usage scenarios for each possible feature on the app.</p><br>
        <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "story board" src = "imgs/grogo/storyboard.gif">
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <p>In addition, I developed a series of <b>storymaps</b> for each persona. From these maps, I am able to distill a <b>common path</b>, which allows me to further developer more granular architecture of the mobile appplication.</p><br>
        <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "story map" src = "imgs/grogo/storymap.jpg">

        <h3>2. Usage Flow</h3><br>
        <div class ="flex-row"><img src = "imgs/grogo/flow_chart.png" alt = "flow chart">
        </div>
        <p>With the <b>story maps</b> as guidance, I was then able to systemize the features in the form of an <b>information architecture flow chart</b>. With such visualization as guidance, the scope of the product is made much clearer. </p>
      <br><br>
      </div>
      <div class = "project-step-row" id="design-process-row-3">
        <h3>3. Paper Prototype</h3><br>
        <div class ="flex-row"><img src = "imgs/grogo/paper.gif" alt = "paper prototype"/></div>
        <p>Before delving into digital prototype, a <b>paper-based prototype model</b> was first created to allow quick user testing and conceptualization. <br><br>
        To make design decisions, I adopted the <b>QoC analysis</b> method, as shown below.</p><br>
        <div class ="flex-row"><img src = "imgs/grogo/qoc.JPG" alt = "QoC diagram"/></div>
        <br><br>
        <p>After it's done, the paper prototype has undergone 6 user testings. Based on user feedback, I have made several improvements:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Changed the name</b> of some features to avoid confision, e.g., 'item group' --> 'favorites'.</li>
        <li>Changed design for <b>scalability consideration</b>, e.g., use carousel presentationfor frequently visited stores.</li>
        <li><b>Changed visual affordances</b> such as icon size to improve usability.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
      </div>
      <div class = "project-step-row" id="design-process-row-4">
        <h3>4. Digital Iterations</h3><br>
        <div class ="flex-row"><img src = "imgs/grogo/homeprocess.gif" alt = "design process"/></div>
        <p>From wireframe to the final design, I have iterate multiple times for the digital prototype, each time followed by a brief user testing for further feedback. <br><br>
        The prototype has had <b>6 different version updates</b> by the end of the project.
