    <h2>Why does in-store grocery shopping have to take that much time?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Grocery shopping is a recurring task that almost no household could excape. However, not everyone enjoys doing it.</p><br>
  </div>
  <div class = "flex-row">
    <div class = "pain-points">
      <h3>I almost always ended up spending much more time than I wanted shopping at the grocery store.</h3>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class = "project-content-text">
    <p>According to The Time Use Institute (2008) survey, <b>US shoppers spend an hour per week shopping for groceries.</b> As time-consuming as it seems, <b>in-store grocery shopping is still preferred over online shopping by 92% of shoppers in the US </b> (ICSC,2018). Undoubtedly, shopping in physical stores allows one to have more control of what he/she gets -- you can handpick the freshest looking produce, or spot special deals that are not listed online. But what about control over time and budget? In fact, based on the results of a small-scaled questionnaire with 16 participants, <b>10 out of 16 people reported to have often or always stayed longer than they expected shopping for groceries.</b> Is there a way to make in-store grocery shopping enjoyable yet efficient? <br><br></p>
    <div class = "flex-row">
      <img src = "imgs/grogo/problem.png" alt="the problem"/>
    </div>
    <p>For the <b>individual project of the course Interaction Design</b>, I aimed to design a solution that streamlines grocery shopping expeirence, <b>giving shoppers back time lost during in-store grocery shopping.</b></p>

    <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">USER RESEARCH</h3>
    <h2>What do people have to say about their shopping experience?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>In order to understand people's pain points doing grocery shopping, I collected and analyzed both quantitative and qualitative data for further ideation.</p><br>

      <br>
        <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Small Sample Survey</h5><br><br>
        <p>A user needs survey was conducted online with 16 volunteers to learn the in-store shoppers' challenges. <b>15 out of 16 respondants were the primary shopper</b> of their households. The survey results showed that <b>10 out of 16 people reported to have often or always stayed longer than they expetected shopping for groceries</b>. These people spend an average of <b>53 minutes per week</b> spent for grocery shopping (Mdn: 52.5). In addition, these 10 people have reported to consider <b>budget-freindliness, distance from the stores, and the variety of product selection</b> when they do grocery shopping.</p><br><br>

            <img src = "imgs/grogo/survey.png" alt = "survey answers"/>
          </div>
        <br><br>
        <p>A series of 5 point Likert scale has been used in the survey to understand how often certain possible challenges have been faced by the respondants. I noticed that <b>three related issues have almost sometimes, very often, or always happened to all 10 respondents who reported to spend more time than they wanted</b> during their shopping expereince: </p><br><br>

        <br><br>
        <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">User Interviews</h5><br>
        <div class ="flex-row"><img alt = "interview icon" src = "imgs/grogo/interview.png"></div>
        <p>In addition to the survey, I also <b>interviewed four different shoppers</b> individually. By <b>having them walk me through their last grocery shopping experience</b>, I uncovered different shoppers' motivations, grocery shopping styles, as well as other pain points related to inefficient shopping. </p><br>
        <div class = "flex-row">
          <div class = "pain-points">

        <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Causal Diagram</h5><br><br>
        <p>From both the survey and interview, I was able to outline the reasons contributing to inefficient shopping experience.</p>

        </div><br><br>
        <p>Aside from preliminary user research, I also examined existing products on the market, including grocery stores' mobile applications, as well as to-do list and meal prep apps. From the analysis, I noticed that <b>grocery store apps have less sophisticated planning features, while meal prep apps or to-do list apps rarely include specific product information</b>. The results implied a possible solution that includes the good of both application types. </p><br><br>

        <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">DEFINE AND SCOPE</h3>
        <h2>Setting up design objective and goals</h2>
        <p>To synthesize the research and interview findings, I have collected all root causes regarding grocery shopping from user research. Since traffic issues such as waiting for the bus or waiting in traffic may drastically affect the scope of project and would be better solved with existing applications, I decided to tackle issues that are related to <b>execution time and decision time</b>. </p><br><br>

          <a href="imgs/grogo/causes.png" target="_blank"><img src="imgs/grogo/causes.png" alt="Scoping the project"/></a>
        </div><br><br>
        <p>I also determined the goals of the design to help users reach their goals while filling the white spaces on the market.</p>

        <br>
          <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">Brainstorming</h5><br><br>
          <p>Before deciding on designing a mobile app, I started to brainstorm <b>as many potential solutions as possible</b>, no matter whether the solution already exists on market or not. For example, one potential solution is pickup service, where users can select desired items prior to their shopping trips and pick up groceries once they arrive. This solution balances users' need for saving time and having fresher food, but the incurred service fee may not save shoppers money. Some other brainstormed solutions include <b>hired shopper service, smart shopping cart, digital shelves, and interactive information wall at store</b>. <br><br>
          In the end, I have considered user needs and contraints, and opted for designing 'groGo'-- a mobile app that serves as a one-stop soltution for in-store shoppers. The considerations are as follows:</p><br><br>

          <br><br>
          <p>After comparing these features with the pain points gathered from the research phase, I have rescoped and refined the functionality of the mobile solution in order to ensure <b>each issue in-store grovcery shoppers might face can be addressed</b>.</p><br><br>

          <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">Storymaps</h5><br><br>
          <br>
          <p>In order to conduct <b>more detailed tasks analysis for each persona concerning how they would use groGo, </b>I developed a series of <b>storymaps</b> for each persona, each includes three layers: activities, tasks, and subtasks. <br><br></p>

          </div>
          <p>With the <b>story maps</b> as guidance, I was then able to systemize the features in the form of an <b>information architecture flow chart</b>. With such visualization as guidance, the scope of the product were made much clearer. <br><br>
          In addition, the flow chart allows me to <b>identify and include different use cases</b> for the application, while <b>determining which features should be made the most accessible on the interface</b>. From the flow chart, I have identified <b>four most frequently used features to be displayed at the most salient places on the app interface: search, shopping list, scanner, and GO mode.</b> These features were mentioned as the <b>first few steps in the persona's scenarios</b>.</p><br><br>
      <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">PROTOTYPE & TEST</h3>
      <h2>Translating ideas to assessible design</h2>
        <br><br>

          <div class ="flex-row black-bg"><img src = "imgs/grogo/paper.gif" alt = "paper prototype"/></div>
          <p>Before delving into digital prototype, a <b>paper-based prototype model</b> was first created to allow quick user testing and conceptualization. <br><br></p>
          <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">QOC Analysis</h5><br><br>
          <p>To make design decisions, I adopted the <b>QOC analysis</b> method to reach the most optimal design option by taking important critera into consideration. For example, please see below on how I came to the decision of including both map view and AR view in the navigation feature.
            .</p><br>
          <div class ="flex-row white-bg">
            <a href="imgs/grogo/qoc.png" target="_blank" data-title="QOC Diagram"><img src="imgs/grogo/qoc.png" alt="QOC Diagram"/></a>

          <div class ="flex-row"><img src = "imgs/grogo/testing.png" alt = "user testing"/></div>
          <br>
          <p>After it's done, the paper prototype has undergone 6 user testing sessions. Based on user feedback, I have made several improvements:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><b>Changed the name</b> of some features to avoid confision, e.g., 'item group' --> 'favorites'.</li>
          <li>Changed design for <b>scalability consideration</b>, e.g., use carousel presentation for frequently visited stores.</li>
          <li><b>Changed visual affordances</b> such as icon size to improve usability.</li>
          </ul>
          <br><br>

          <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">Digital Prototype</h5><br><br>

          </div>
          <br><br>
          <p>For the digital prototype, I first developed a color scheme and style guide for the application's visual elements. The color blue is selected as the parimary hue of the palette, as <b>blue light can activate parts of the brain related to attention and alterness (Lockley et al., 2006; Lehrl et al., 2007)</b>, which may contribute to better efficiency for grocery item searching, list planning and navigating tasks.</p>

          <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">THE FINAL DESIGN</h3>
          <h2>groGo - A planner, a trainer, and a navigator</h2>
          <br>
          <p>The final solution is a mobile application -- groGo, which <b>targets in-store grocery shoppers who wish their shopping trips could be more efficient</b>. From grocery planning to expense tracking, the solution will serve as <b>a planner, a trainer, and a navigator throughout the whole grocery journey</b>. Unlike most other products on the market, it <b>does not restrict itself to any specific grocery store</b>, but instead leverages its powerful database that integrates product information across different grocery brands.</p>

          <h2>Minimizing myself as a user during the process</h2>
          <p><br>Since the project stemmed from my personal painful experience when doing grocery, I would have mistaken my problem as everyone else's. It is however through user survey and interviews that I gradually delineated possible different users and their journey, as well as their true needs. Similarly, I had too many ideas upfront and were trying to realize all of them in my design. However, through the process of definition, user flow generation, and multiple testings and iterations, I learned the more is not always the better from my users, especially when my solution is specifically designed to save people time. </p>

    <h3>Scenario</h3><br>
    <p>It’s Saturday morning. Brianna wakes up straight at 6 and still feels tired – she had been hanging out with her coworkers all night. She takes a look at her schedule and gets up immediately. ‘Time waits no man,’ she thinks, with strong determination to complete all her chores by lunch.<br><br>While having breakfast, she browses groGo – her grocery shopping helper, and swiftly adds different pre-established item groups to a newly generated list. The App suggests that traffic at her nearby store will be busy at 9:30. Without further due, she quickly changed and leaves her apartment. <br><br>Upon arrival, Brianna activates the GO mode and lets groGo take the lead. Before she starts moving, groGo pops up a challenge ‘Finish shopping in 40 minute, and win a coupon!’ What a piece of cake, Brianna thinks. Within 20 minutes, she already picks up enough food for 12 meals thanks to groGo’s AR map feature. With the help of the ingredient scanner, she also dodges a few high-carb items that are on the list, and opts for lower ones. <br><br> Coming home, Brianna feels happy that she has a good start of the day. She completes her shopping 20 minutes sooner than before, and earns an exciting coupon just because of that. ‘Time is money’, she firmly believes it.</p>

And suddenly, she spots a brand new product – Thai red curry paste. She loves Thai food and has always thought about making it by herself. Allergic to nuts, however, she isn’t sure whether the paste will be safe. <br><br>She opens her groGo app and activates her ingredient scannr. Within a second, the screen shows that the food is safe for her, based on a customized allergic list she has input before. On the app, she also learns that the product has over 4.5/5 rating by other customers. ‘This must be good!’ she thinks, and puts the item in her cart exciting to see how tasty curry she can make.</p>
