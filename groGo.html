      <br>
        <h5 class ="grogo-title-tag">Small Sample Survey</h5><br><br>
        <p>A user needs survey was conducted online with 16 volunteers to learn the in-store shoppers' challenges. 15 out of 16 respondants were the primary shopper of their households. The survey results showed that 10 out of 16 people reported to have often or always stayed longer than they expetected shopping for groceries. These people spend an average of 53 minutes per week for grocery shopping (Mdn: 52.5). In addition, these 10 people have reported to consider <b>budget-freindliness, distance from the stores, and the variety of product selection</b> when they do grocery shopping.</p><br><br>

        <p>Aside from preliminary user research, I also examined existing products on the market, including grocery stores' mobile applications, as well as to-do list and meal prep apps.

        <h2>Setting up design objective and goals</h2>
        <p>To synthesize the research and interview findings, I have collected all root causes regarding grocery shopping from user research. Since traffic issues such as waiting for the bus or waiting in traffic may drastically affect the scope of project and would be better solved with existing applications, I decided to tackle issues that are related to <b>execution time and decision time</b>. </p><br><br>

          <p>I brainstormed <b>eight possible features</b> for the mobile app, and visualized them in <b>storyboards</b> depicting their usage scenarios.</p><br><br>
        </div>

      <div class = "project-content-text">
          <br><br><br>
          <p>After evaluation, I have rescoped and refined the functionality of the mobile solution in order to ensure <b>most pain points in-store grovcery shoppers might face can be addressed</b>.</p><br><br>

          <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">Usage Flow</h5><br><br>
          <p>With the <b>story maps</b> as guidance, I systemized the features in the form of an <b>information architecture flow chart</b>.</p>

      <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">PROTOTYPE & TEST</h3>
      <h2>Translating ideas to assessible design</h2>
        <br><br>
          <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">Paper Prototype</h5><br><br>
          <p>Before delving into digital prototype, a <b>paper-based prototype model</b> was first created to allow quick user testing and conceptualization.</p><br><br>
          <div class ="flex-row black-bg"><img src = "imgs/grogo/paper.gif" class="img-height-450px" alt = "paper prototype"/></div>
          <br><br><br>
          <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">QOC Analysis</h5><br><br>
          <p>To make design decisions, I adopted the <b>QOC analysis</b> method to reach the most optimal design option by taking important critera into consideration when evaluating options that address a design question.</p><br>
          <div class ="flex-row white-bg">
            <a href="imgs/grogo/qoc.png" target="_blank" data-title="QOC Diagram"><img src="imgs/grogo/qoc.png" alt="QOC Diagram"/></a>
          </div>
          <br><br><br>
          <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">User Testing</h5><br><br>
          <p>Time to put my first design to test and collect feedback! The paper prototype has undergone 6 user testing sessions.</p>
          <div class ="flex-row"><img class="img-height-450px" src = "imgs/grogo/testing.png" alt = "user testing"/></div>
          <br>
          <p>Based on user feedback, I have made several improvements:
          <ul>
          <li><b>Changed the name</b> of some features to avoid confision, e.g., 'item group' --> 'favorites'.</li>
          <li>Changed design for <b>scalability consideration</b>, e.g., use carousel presentation for frequently visited stores.</li>
          <li><b>Changed visual affordances</b> such as icon size to improve usability.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <br><br><br>

          <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">Digital Prototype</h5><br><br>
          <p>For the digital prototype, I developed a color scheme and style guide for the application's visual elements.</p>
          <div class ="flex-row white-bg">
            <a href="imgs/grogo/style_guide.png" data-lightbox="style_guide" data-title="Style Guide"><img src="imgs/grogo/style_guide.png" alt="competitive analysis"/></a>
          </div>
          <br><br>
           <p>The color blue is selected as the parimary hue of the palette, as <b>blue light can activate parts of the brain related to attention and alterness (Lockley et al., 2006; Lehrl et al., 2007)</b>, which may contribute to better efficiency when users perform tasks such as searching for grocery items, planning shopping list and navigation in the store.</p>
          <br><br><br>

          <h5 class = "grogo-title-tag">Design Changes</h5><br><br>
          <p>I have iterated multiple times working on the digital prototype, <b>each time followed by a brief user testing on certain task</b> for further feedback and usability check. Some key changes I have made before reaching the final design include:</p>
          <div class ="flex-row">
            <a href="imgs/grogo/homeprocess.png" data-lightbox="home process" data-title="Home page dashboard design changes"><img src = "imgs/grogo/homeprocess.png" alt = "homepage iteration process"/></a>
          </div>
          <div class="slidetext-multi">
            <h2>Re-designed the dashboard on the home page</h2><br>
            <h4>Before: </h4>
            <p>Plain numeric display for progress, budget and shopping time.</p>
            <h4>After: </h4>
            <p>Add progress bar for GO points to motivate users. Display user's own goal at the bottom of current expenses and shopping time, with trend tracking feature to check historic performance.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class ="flex-row">
            <a href="imgs/grogo/searchprocess.png" data-lightbox="search process" data-title="Search results design changes"><img src = "imgs/grogo/searchprocess.png" alt = "search restuls iteration process"/></a>
          </div>
          <div class="slidetext-multi">
            <h2>Changed the concept of features to match with real world experience</h2><br>
            <h4>Before: </h4>
            <p>Same button design for 'add to list' and 'add to group'. Users had problem differentiating both concepts, and they were prone to tap the wrong button.</p>
            <h4>After: </h4>
            <p>Change the term 'group' to 'favorites' to avoid misunderstanding. Use a heart-shaped icon to signify it's a long-term, regularly purchsed item.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class ="flex-row">

          <div class="slidetext-multi">
            <h2>Redesigned the shopping list on in-store map</h2><br>
            <h4>Before: </h4>
            <p>Items were presented in a horizontal scroll menu, ordered by aisle number.</p>
            <h4>After: </h4>
            <p>Use a minimizable, vertical menu to match the shopping list page design. Allow users to check individual item on the route by tapping the pin icon.

          <h3 class = "project-content-section-name">REFLECTIONS</h3>
          <h2>Minimizing myself as a user during the process</h2>
          <p><br>Since the project stemmed from my personal painful experience when doing grocery, I would have mistaken my own problem to be everyone else's problem. It is however through user survey and interviews that I gradually delineated possible different users and their journey, as well as their true needs. Similarly, I had too many ideas upfront and were trying to realize all of them in my design. However, through the process of definition, user flow generation, and multiple testings and iterations, I learned the more is not always the better from my users, especially when my solution is specifically designed to save people time.</p>

    <h2>Brianna Brown</h2><br>
    <h3>Scenario</h3><br>
    <p>It’s Saturday morning. Brianna wakes up straight at 6 and still feels tired – she had been hanging out with her coworkers all night. She takes a look at her schedule and gets up immediately. ‘Time waits no man,’ she thinks, with strong determination to complete all her chores by lunch.<br><br>While having breakfast, she browses groGo – her grocery shopping helper, and swiftly adds different pre-established item groups to a newly generated list. The App suggests that traffic at her nearby store will be busy at 9:30. Without further due, she quickly changed and leaves her apartment. <br><br>Upon arrival, Brianna activates the GO mode and lets groGo take the lead. Before she starts moving, groGo pops up a challenge ‘Finish shopping in 40 minute, and win a coupon!’ What a piece of cake, Brianna thinks. Within 20 minutes, she already picks up enough food for 12 meals thanks to groGo’s AR map feature. With the help of the ingredient scanner, she also dodges a few high-carb items that are on the list, and opts for lower ones. <br><br> Coming home, Brianna feels happy that she has a good start of the day. She completes her shopping 20 minutes sooner than before, and earns an exciting coupon just because of that. ‘Time is money’, she firmly believes it.</p>

And suddenly, she spots a brand new product – Thai red curry paste. She loves Thai food and has always thought about making it by herself. Allergic to nuts, however, she isn’t sure whether the paste will be safe. <br><br>She opens her groGo app and activates her ingredient scannr. Within a second, the screen shows that the food is safe for her, based on a customized allergic list she has input before. On the app, she also learns that the product has over 4.5/5 rating by other customers. ‘This must be good!’ she thinks, and puts the item in her cart exciting to see how tasty curry she can make.</p>
